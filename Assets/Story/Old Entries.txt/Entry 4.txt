23 November 1605

		Unfortunately, his majesty has declined to attend the Conference of Kings once again.  Truth be told, the decision was quite abrupt and more than a little impromptu.  It was delivered to me and Prince Nocent Prodigium outside the courts earlier this week, whilst his majesty made a hasty retreat to his chambers.
		The decision, never mind the manner in which it was delivered, has left me and the rest of his cabinet feeling increasingly anxious for our king.  Last year, when Queen Vosunt-Dien Prodigium passed away, our bordering countries were more than willing to excuse his majesty's lack of attendance.  But since then, it seems as though he has only slipped further into despair.  He will no longer eat in the mess hall with his subjects, and his weekly speeches to the populace from Etiamare Fountain have become monthly...
		I will, of course, attend the conference in his majesty's place, and do my best to defend his good name.  But I must have a talk with him soon.  He has always been there for his country, and now, it is time for his country to be there for him.
