		His Majesty's plan to exit Veterria was a resounding success!  His cloaking spells allowed us to escape the castle and cross the border completely undetected.  More than this, we have already travelled as far as the Genesterian outskirts!  As I speak, our great King stands guard while we, His cabinet, rest and recuperate from the day's journey.
		It is calm here, with only the gentle chirping of crickets to accentuate the blissfully silent evening.  Even the snoring of stalwart Dexortus, who initially objected to the journey, grows silent as he shifts closer to the enchanted fire His Majesty has cast to warm us.
		But I am far too excited to even think of resting!  Of all those who lived in the castle, of all those who served Him, we alone were selected as the accompanying party of this journey!  We chosen few have even received the grace of His magic, which was said to have further strengthened our dedication to His Majesty.  From now on, we will aid King Talem Prodigium in His quest to find peace, to find a place far, far away from Veterria...
		I cannot wait for the journey to begin!
