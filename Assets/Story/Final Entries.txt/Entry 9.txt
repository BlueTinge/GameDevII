Once we are transformed, His Majesty will make us immortal, like Him.  Our souls will be tied to the magical vats which His Majesty has placed around the Occultarrim.  If we are struck down, our souls will be drawn back into them, such that His Majesty may resurrect us in the future.  It is for this reason that we must protect the vats at all costs, for if one is destroyed, all of those whose souls are tied to it will then become mortal once more.
The very idea of living forever, alongside the great King Talem Prodigium...I can hardly contain my excitement!
