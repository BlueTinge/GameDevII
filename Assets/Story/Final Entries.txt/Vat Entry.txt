		Once we become immortal, our life source will be managed in a similar way to his majesty's.  In our case, our ties to this world will be the magical vats his majesty has place around the tower.

It is for this reason that we must protect the vats at all costs, for if one is destroyed, all of those whose souls are tied to it will then become mortal once more.
		The idea of living forever, alongside the great King Talem Prodigium...I can hardly contain my excitement!
