23 November 1604

For the second year in a row, his majesty has declined to attend the annual Conference of Kings.  In addition, his majesty's absences from the mess hall during mealtimes continue to increase in consistency.  My fellow cabinet members and I have been left thoroughly concerned for his majesty's health.
I must have a talk with him soon.  Talem has always been there for his country, and now, it is time for his country to be there for him.
