Thanks to His Majesty's cloaking spells, we have made it as far as the Genesterian outskirts in but a single night!  King Talem Prodigium's plan to exit Veterria is a resounding success.
Soon, we will find a place for His Majesty to settle down and revel in His immortality from now until the end of time.  I cannot wait to be of service to Him!
