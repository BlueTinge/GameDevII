30 December 1609

Some years have passed since I began living in the Occultarrim with His Majesty, and He has confided in me that he is unsure of His cabinet's devotion to Him.  He worries that they might one day betray Him in some way.
I reacted, of course, in surprise and confusion.  If we are causing His Majesty grief, then He may do whatever He feels is necessary to alleviate that grief.  After all, His Majesty's well being is more important all of ours combined.
His Majesty seemed at ease when I left the conversation.  I am beyond ecstatic that I was able to ease His mind!
