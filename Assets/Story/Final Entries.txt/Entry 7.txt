30 December 1609

Today, His Majesty confided in me the worry that His cabinet might one day betray Him, despite the obedience spell that He has placed them under.
I reacted, of course, in surprise and confusion.  If we are causing His Majesty grief, then He may do whatever He feels is necessary to alleviate that grief.
After all, His Majesty's well being is far more important than ours.
