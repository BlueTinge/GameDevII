30 December 1609

Some years have passed since I began living in the Occultarrim with His Majesty, and He has confided in me that He is unsure of His cabinet's devotion to Him.  He worries that they might one day betray Him, despite the spell that He has placed them under.
I reacted, of course, in surprise and confusion.  If we are causing His Majesty grief, then He may do whatever He feels is necessary to alleviate that grief.  After all, His Majesty's well being is more important than ours.
His Majesty seemed at ease when our conversation concluded.  I am beyond ecstatic that I was able to ease His mind!
