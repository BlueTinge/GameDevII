The construction of the Occultarrim is progressing smoothly!  My fellow cabinet members and I work day and night to create His Majesty's new sanctum, far from the troubles and tribulations of modern society.
Much like the absolute obedience spell which He placed us under before we left Veterria, the strength-enhancing and fatigue-reducing spells which He endowed us with today will increase our ability to serve Him effectively!  Our King continues to be thoughtful and mindful of His loyal subjects.
