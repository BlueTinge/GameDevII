20 May 1597

		It pleases me greatly to say that the talks with the Genesterian counsel were 
	a success!  The old trade deal we shared with them, that thorn which has poked and 
	prodded us since the reign of the previous king, has finally been nipped.  Even now, 
	I can scarcely believe how simple it will be to keep our exports within the newly 
	established restrictions – a royal secretary’s life has never been so easy!

		I only wish that I could say the same for his majesty.  Every day, he seems 
	to grow yet wearier.  He will not say what plagues him, but I suspect that it has 
	something to do with the passing of his brother in the northernmost regions of 
	Primidius.  Though it has been some months, his majesty has not been the same since.  
	None can blame him, of course.  The loss of a loved one pierces the armor of kings 
	just as keenly as it does the tatters of peasants.  Still, it is not like King Talem 
	Prodigium to dwell.

		It is a truth which all kings must struggle with, I suspect – that every man, 
	no matter how great, has his time.  I do hope, in the months that lie ahead, that he 
	will confide in me, as he has done so many times before, and make peace with himself.
