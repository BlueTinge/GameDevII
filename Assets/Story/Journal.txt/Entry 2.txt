		The hydra which our scouts spotted milling about close to our southern border has been found and dealt with.  His majesty insisted on accompanying the soldiers, and thus, I came, as well.  I say - once we found our quarry, he lifted his enchanted sword with the strength of ten men and dispatched of the monster effortlessly!  It is not often that one bears witness to King Talem Prodigium's combat skills firsthand, and I must say that doing so has greatly reaffirmed my respect for how responsibly he handles the great powers which the heavens have seen fit to grant him.
		On the subject of his powers, my thoughts now drift to the greatest of his endeavors thus far, that secret with which he has shared only his closest of consultants.  I must admit, I was quite unsure when his majesty came to me with the news of his immortality spell.  It sounded too fantastic to believe, and yet, two years later, it truly seems that he has not aged a day!  Of course, two years is a paltry amount compared to a lifetime, and he has not discussed the details of his immortality since.  But after seeing how he moved today, such a thing does not seem quite so unbelievable.
		Well, if it IS true, may Veterria sleep soundly knowing that she will be in capable hands for all eternity.
